# Thesis on Optimization of Error Identification Software for NAO Robots in RoboCup Soccer League

## Introduction

This thesis is dedicated to the optimization of error identification software for NAO robots used in the Open Soccer League of RoboCup, an organization aimed at promoting research in robotics across various fields such as soccer, rescue, and home automation. The primary objective of RoboCup is to define regulations that encourage the development and progress of robotics research.

The SPQR team from Sapienza University participates in this league, which is unique due to the use of a universal platform shared by all teamsâ€”the NAO robot. This robot boasts exceptional motor capabilities and a sophisticated sensory system, which teams must utilize to enable the robot to play autonomously.

## Challenges

Despite the advanced capabilities of the NAO robot, the league imposes several limitations, including limited internal memory and embedded processors with restricted performance. These constraints raise issues that are rarely considered in modern environments characterized by ever-growing computational power. 

## Objective

The main goal of this thesis is to address these challenges by optimizing the error identification software, aiming to reduce the amount of data stored and transmitted without compromising the robot's computational performance. Various solution approaches will be explored to tackle this complex problem.

## Solution Approaches

three different approaches to solving the problem are presented:

1. **Matrix Mapping through Base Conversion**
   - This approach involves mapping matrices via a base conversion method, aiming to efficiently encode and process data.

2. **Mapping through an Ordered Dictionary**
   - This method uses an ordered dictionary for mapping, which helps in organizing and retrieving data systematically.

3. **Use of a Neural Network**
   - A neural network is employed to learn and identify errors, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for improved performance.

## Conclusion

This thesis aims to provide significant contributions to the field of robotics by optimizing error identification software for NAO robots in the context of the RoboCup Open Soccer League. Through a structured approach, the research addresses critical limitations and proposes effective solutions to enhance the performance and efficiency of these autonomous robots.
